# Chat-Room
This is a chat application I individually designed and built in 3 weeks. It is not built on friends-adding structure like Messenger, but chatrooms-join/create structure.

Despite the short of time, I was able to build in this project some functionalities such as: 
- Profile's avatar
- Decoded messages and passwords
- Sending pictures and saving high quality pictures
- Online and typing check
- Email verification
- Low send/receive messages latency (if the internet connection is stable)
- Notification

I have replaced all the passwords and secret links in the source code so you won't be able see them. If you want to use the app, please download it from the following link:

It's a desktop app so in order to run it, your pc/laptop must use Windows OS and have .Net framework of version at least 4.7.2 installed on your pc/laptop. Enjoy!
